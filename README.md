## More Information on the Program

You can use the .NET Framework Early Access builds to try out new features in the .NET Framework and for validating that your apps are compatible with new .NET Framework versions. As a member of the .NET Framework Early Access community, you will have an active role in helping us build new .NET Framework products.

The .NET Framework early access builds will replace any existing .NET Framework 4.x installation on your machine. This means all .NET Framework 4.x applications on your machine will run on the .NET Framework early access builds upon installation. These builds are recommended for testing and not for production deployments.
